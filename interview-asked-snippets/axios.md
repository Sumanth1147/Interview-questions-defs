Axios is a popular JavaScript library used for making HTTP requests. It is commonly used in React, Vue, and Node.js applications to fetch or send data to a server.

Benefits of Using Axios
Simplified API Requests

Instead of using fetch(), Axios provides a cleaner and more readable syntax for making HTTP requests.

Example:

js

axios.get(url).then((res) => console.log(res.data));
Handles JSON Automatically

Axios automatically parses JSON responses, so there's no need to manually call .json() as with the fetch API.

Supports Request and Response Interceptors

You can modify requests before they are sent or process responses before they reach your component.

Example: Adding an authorization token:

js

axios.interceptors.request.use((config) => {
  config.headers.Authorization = `Bearer your-token`;
  return config;
});
Handles Errors More Efficiently

Axios provides a built-in way to handle errors with .catch(), making error management more structured.

Example:

js

axios.get(url)
  .then(response => console.log(response.data))
  .catch(error => console.error("Error:", error.message));
Supports Canceling Requests

Helps prevent race conditions when dealing with multiple API calls.

Example:

js
Copy
Edit
const controller = new AbortController();
axios.get(url, { signal: controller.signal }).catch(err => console.log(err));
