// What Are Google Core Web Vitals?
// Google Core Web Vitals are a set of metrics developed by Google to measure the real-world user experience on web pages. High scores on Core Web Vitals can help to ensure a good user experience and improve rankings on Google’s search engine results pages.

// Core Web Vitals include:

// Largest Contentful Paint (LCP): This is the time it takes for the largest content element to become fully rendered in the portion of the web page the viewer sees. This metric helps development teams understand how users perceive the page load speed. A good LCP score is considered to be 2.5 seconds or faster.

// Cumulative Layout Shift (CLS): This measures the amount of unexpected shifting and changing in the page layout that a viewer experiences. This is a measure of visual stability. A good CLS score is less than 0.1.

// Interaction to Next Paint (INP): This measures latency of all clicks, taps, and keyboard interactions with the page throughout its lifespan and reports the single metric which all interactions are under. It’s a measure of responsiveness and indicates when a page is consistently able to respond quickly to most users. INP replaced First Input Delay (FID) in March 2024.
// Understanding and optimizing these metrics can help development teams build more responsive and engaging web pages and websites.

// The importance of Google Core Web Vitals
// In the digital world, the quality of user interactions with websites is closely connected with business success. Users and customers expect websites to load quickly, be visually pleasing, be easy to navigate, and to offer seamless functionality and interactivity. When websites load too slowly and perform poorly, users are likely to go elsewhere to get information or buy products. As a result, poorly performing sites degrade user satisfaction, damage brand perception, and negatively impact the bottom line.

// Monitoring and optimizing for Google Core Web Vitals performance metrics helps site owners deliver the best possible user experiences. Additionally, because search engines like Google factor Core Web Vitals data into rankings, optimizing for these metrics can help increase organic search and broaden the customer base.
