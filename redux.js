//  Redux is a state management library commonly used with React to manage the state of our application in a predictable way. It helps you manage the global state of our app, making it easier to share data between components and handle complex state logic.

// 1. Store
// The store is the central place where the entire state of your application is stored. It holds the global state as a single JavaScript object. You can think of it as a "database" for your app's state.

// The store is created using the createStore function (or configureStore in modern Redux)

// 2. Action
// An action is a plain JavaScript object that describes what happened in our app. It is the only way to change the state in Redux.

// 3. Reducer
// A reducer is a pure function that takes the current state and an action, and returns the new state. It decides how the state should change based on the action.

// 4. Dispatch
// To update the state, you dispatch an action to the store. The store then calls the reducer with the current state and the action, and the reducer returns the new state.

// Example Workflow
// A user clicks a button to add a new todo.

// An action (ADD_TODO) is dispatched.

// The reducer receives the action and updates the state.

// The store saves the new state.

// React components connected to the store re-render with the updated state.

// Redux is a state management library commonly used with React to manage the state of your application in a predictable way. It helps you manage the global state of your app, making it easier to share data between components and handle complex state logic.

// Here’s a simple explanation of the key concepts in Redux:

// 1. Store
// The store is the central place where the entire state of your application is stored. It holds the global state as a single JavaScript object. You can think of it as a "database" for your app's state.

// The store is created using the createStore function (or configureStore in modern Redux).

// You can access the state using store.getState().

// You can update the state by dispatching actions.

// 2. Action
// An action is a plain JavaScript object that describes what happened in your app. It is the only way to change the state in Redux.

// Actions must have a type property (a string) that describes the action (e.g., "ADD_TODO").

// They can also have additional data (called the payload) to pass information to the reducer.

// Example of an action:

// javascript
// Copy
// {
//   type: "ADD_TODO",
//   payload: {
//     text: "Learn Redux",
//     id: 1
//   }
// }
// Actions are typically created using action creators, which are functions that return action objects:

// javascript
// Copy
// const addTodo = (text) => {
//   return {
//     type: "ADD_TODO",
//     payload: {
//       text: text,
//       id: Date.now()
//     }
//   };
// };
// 3. Reducer
// A reducer is a pure function that takes the current state and an action, and returns the new state. It decides how the state should change based on the action.

// Reducers must be pure functions (no side effects).

// They should not modify the existing state directly; instead, they return a new state object.

// Example of a reducer:

// javascript
// Copy
const initialState = {
  todos: []
};

const todoReducer = (state = initialState, action) => {
  switch (action.type) {
    case "ADD_TODO":
      return {
        ...state,
        todos: [...state.todos, action.payload]
      };
    default:
      return state;
  }
};
// 4. Dispatch
// To update the state, you dispatch an action to the store. The store then calls the reducer with the current state and the action, and the reducer returns the new state.

// Example of dispatching an action:

// javascript
// Copy
// store.dispatch(addTodo("Learn Redux"));
// How It All Works Together
// Store: Holds the global state.

// Action: Describes what happened (e.g., "ADD_TODO").

// Reducer: Takes the current state and the action, and returns the new state.

// Dispatch: Sends the action to the store to update the state.

// Example Workflow
// A user clicks a button to add a new todo.

// An action (ADD_TODO) is dispatched.

// The reducer receives the action and updates the state.

// The store saves the new state.

// React components connected to the store re-render with the updated state.

// Why Use Redux?
// Centralized State: All your app's state is in one place, making it easier to manage.

// Predictable State Changes: Reducers ensure state changes are predictable and traceable.

// Easier Debugging: Tools like Redux DevTools let you track every action and state change.

// Modern Redux (Redux Toolkit)
// Modern Redux uses the Redux Toolkit to simplify the process. It provides utilities like createSlice to automatically generate actions and reducers, and configureStore to set up the store with less boilerplate.

// Example with Redux Toolkit:

// javascript
// Copy
import { createSlice, configureStore } from '@reduxjs/toolkit';

const todoSlice = createSlice({
  name: 'todos',
  initialState: { todos: [] },
  reducers: {
    addTodo: (state, action) => {
      state.todos.push(action.payload);
    }
  }
});

const store = configureStore({
  reducer: todoSlice.reducer
});

export const { addTodo } = todoSlice.actions;
export default store;
// In summary, Redux helps you manage the state of your React app in a structured and predictable way using actions, reducers, and a store. It’s especially useful for large apps with complex state logic.
